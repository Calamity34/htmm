    <h1>Before You Ask</h1>
    <h4>Before asking a technical question by E-Mail, in a newsgroup, on a forum or a chat board consider the following first:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Try to find an answer by searching the archives of the forum or the mailing list</li>
        <li>Try to find an answer by searching it up in DuckDuckGo/Google</li>
        <li>Try to find an answer in the manual/docs</li>
        <li>Try to find an answer by reading a FAQ list</li>
        <li>Try to find an answer by inspection or experimentation</li>
        <li>Try to find an answer by asking a skilled friend if you have one</li>
        <li>If you're good at programming - try to find the answer in the source code if avalible</li>
    </ol>
    <p>When you ask your question, display the fact that you have done these things first; this will help establish that you're not being a lazy sponge and wasting people's time. Better yet, display what you have learned from doing these things, you will be able to get much more help from demonstrating it.</p>
